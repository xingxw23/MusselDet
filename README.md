MusselDet: A Detection and Instance Segmentation Framework for Golden Mussel Lifecycle Monitoring

This repository provides the official implementation of MusselDet, a transformer-based model designed to detect and segment different life stages of the invasive golden mussel (Limnoperna fortunei), a major biofouling threat to large-scale water transfer systems. Built on an enhanced Co-DETR architecture, MusselDet integrates three novel modules: (1) CA-CBAM for class-aware attention under sparse conditions, (2) LDGCN for temporal-spatial graph-based feature recovery, and (3) MLST for fine-grained instance segmentation.

📌 Features:

End-to-end detection and segmentation of mussel larvae and adults

High performance on the custom-built Golden Mussel Dataset (GMD)

Lightweight, real-time deployment ready

📁 Dataset and model weights available upon request.
